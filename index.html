<li><b>1942</b>: After her father died of a heart condition, movie company Navyug Chitrapat owner Vinayak Damodar Karnataki, who was a close friend of the Mangeshkars, helped bring the then young girl's singing and acting career on track.

<li><b>1948</b>: Mangeshkar was mentored by music director Ghulam Haider right after Karnataki's death. After getting rejected by producer Sashadhar Mukherjee's 'Shaheed', Mangeshkar got mainstream with 'Majboor' with the song 'Dil Mera Toda, Mujhe Kahin Ka Na Chhora'.</li>
<li><b>1949</b>: 'Aayega Aanewaala', featuring classic actress Madhubala, was her major hits from the movie 'Mahal'.</li>
<li><b>1950s</b>: Mangeshkar saw great scope in movies, and produced four films - Marathi film 'Vaadal' (1953), and Hindi movies 'Jhaanjhar' (1953) and 'Kanchan Ganga' (1955).</li>
<li><b>1963</b>: 'Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo' in Mangeshkar's soulful voice brought tears to the eyes of every citizen and the then Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, during the Sino-Indian War.</li>
<li><b>1999</b>: She won her Padma Vibhushan - the second-highest civilian award for her "exceptional and distinguished service" to the nation.</li>

    I am anguished beyond words. The kind and caring Lata Didi has
        left us. She leaves a void in our nation that cannot be filled.
        The coming generations will remember her as a stalwart of Indian
        culture, whose melodious voice had an unparalleled ability to
        mesmerise people.
